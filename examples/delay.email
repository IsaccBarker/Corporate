Hi Ainsley,
    Regretfully, I must bring to attension two bugs that might effect our bottom line, as fixing these would require
a substantial delay. Following up on your meeting, would you be willing to commucate in person once more? Just wanted
to run changing the project deadline up the flagpoll, and I hope we can sort this out and not involve upper management,
but if nessisary I'll ping Claire and Carolina and have them in the loop regarding this chain. Lets consider our clients
first and foremost, but we may have have to table this to reach our bottom line. I'd like to sincerely apologize to our
clients, if this doesn't work out.

    Regretfully,
    Vivian

Hey Vivian,
    Hope you're having a wonderful day, and that this email finds you well. Concerning those two points you've brought up
concerning an unexpected that you and your team have encounted. We don't currently have any leway here, as our next deployment
is only four days away. With two more serious production-exclusive bugs, I'm afraid that this won't track well with your
record here. We can keep deploying the legacy code, but that would require us providing very slow service. It's always an option,
but it would be much better if you could have your team crunch, and get us the software we need to keep providing the exelent
service that this company is known for. We may have to incude upper management if this doesn't work out.

    Kind regards,
    Ainsley
